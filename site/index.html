    <section id="test">I'm using this section as a test link. I gave it the name test, and will try calling to it from
        above. That didn't work, I think id is the proper attribute. That worked beautifully. Though I don't quite
        understand the name part as I have one set up that doesn't seem to want to work the way I thought it'd work. <a
            href="#testlink">If this works, it should send you back up to the link that brought you here.</a>
        that just about cements my understanding of links, so far. Something I didn't note about fragment identifiers,
        though, is that you can share where you are in a page

this one wasn't size specified, so it populated to its full size. not specifying size is bad for layout as things become
jumpy.
