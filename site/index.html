    <section id="test">I'm using this section as a test link. I gave it the name test, and will try calling to it from
        above. That didn't work, I think id is the proper attribute. That worked beautifully. Though I don't quite
        understand the name part as I have one set up that doesn't seem to want to work the way I thought it'd work. <a
            href="#testlink">If this works, it should send you back up to the link that brought you here.</a>
        that just about cements my understanding of links, so far. Something I didn't note about fragment identifiers,
        though, is that you can share where you are in a page

    this one wasn't size specified, so it populated to its full size. not specifying size is bad for layout as things
    become
    jumpy.

<!-- it is interesting to note that using body on top of a body will display the body with a
declared attribute (blue violet color in this case.) doing so will result 
in changing the browser color, as desired. but that's the whole page. -->
<!-- according to the lecture though, it could be something else
I think it might be the default browser settings. one uber work around I wasn't willing to
resort to quite yet was changing all things with the universal selector, but i'll do that now.-->
<!-- it looks the way I want it now, but everything else no longer has margins or padding sooooooo... -->
<!-- I noticed that in the lecture he set the body's margin and padding to 0, I haven't done that so I'll comment out the universal selector. -->
<!-- both kinda do the same thing, I'll stick with the body behaving this way -->

<!-- margins when left to right are cumulative. From top and down they collapse -->

<p class="talus">Testing background property, it's interesting as it just takes a slice of the picture if it can't all
    fit. IT ALSO SLOWLY SLIDES OVER PICTURES. I could see this as a good way (paired with tags) to expose and hide
    things without having to add overly interactive elements</p>

    <p>I didn't write anything, but tried changing the folder. I want to see if being in a lower folder is okay for
        browser sync</p>
    <p>it would appear as though that doesn't work</p>
    <p>that's kinda sad</p>
